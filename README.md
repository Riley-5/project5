## Background
South Africa's roads have become increasingly bad over the years with numerous potholes, burst water pipes along roads and robots (traffic lights) not working.
Due to various reasons such as management, finances and resources 
a good majority of these incidents do not get fixed in a timely manner or at all depending on the incidents location. 

## Idea Behind the Project
Building an application to crowd source road incidents such as accidents, potholes, burst water pipes, road works and broken robots (traffic lights) 
will not only let other drivers know which areas are bad and can avoid them but can be intergrated into a municipalities or State Owned Enterprise systems
so that they can see exactly where work needs to be done. This may also improve their management systems as often incidents will be reported as fixed on their side
whereas they have in actuality not been fixed. 

### How it works
Any signed in user can click on the map to add a road incident which will be added to the map and visually displayed as a point. 
A popup will appear on the point prompting the user to select what kind road incident they have experianced from the available options
(pothole, accident, road works, broken robot (traffic light) and burst pipe).
Once the user has submitted the form the point will be recorded on the map and added to an incidents log.
The incidents log is a record of all points that have ever been recorded and will show the
name of the user that added the point, what kind of incident it was and the date it was added.
